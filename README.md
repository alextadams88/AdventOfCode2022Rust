Attempting to solve the 2022 Advent of Code challenges in Rust.

In order to run the challenges, it should be as easy as:
1) Check out the repo.
2) Install rustup (https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
3) Update the path on line 7 in /src/common/input.rs to match your filesystem path.
4) In /src/main.rs, make sure that it's pointing to the solution you want to execute
5) `cargo run`
